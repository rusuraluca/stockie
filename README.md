# Stockie - Stock management web app 

- Authentification system with JWT tokens, user roles, and a chat page using web sockets.
- Implemented pagination on both client and server to handle the immense amount of data handled by the database. 
- Build the REST API with filter and statistical functionalities, including a machine learning model to predict stock prices using a linear regression algorithm.
- Wrote E2E tests for the application and used JMeter to do stress (spike) tests to check how the number of users affects the CPU usage and the request response times.
- Hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, I secured and improved the server by first using an nginx reverse proxy server, and then by dockerizing the application.
